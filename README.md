# KitchHub: Recipe Database
Dedicated for 2 features:
  - [ ] Database of the recipes:       [***Work on this now***]
      - What to store -> Attributes...
      - How to store -> Dict, Tables...
  
  - [x] Search Algorithm for recipes:
      - For any set of user input (Ingredients). Must return all recipes that can be made.
  - [ ] Scope calculations:
      - Needs to be tested for larger data sets. Seems fast enough for 20k Recipes and 130 Ingredients
      - Needs to calculate time and space complexities.
